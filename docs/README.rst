Overview
--------

In the command line interface (CLI), use `transcriptic --help` for a summary of
arguments and their function.

Transcriptic library objects are developed with Jupyter notebooks in mind and are best utilized
alongside that interface. Use `transcriptic.object` and `transcriptic.analysis` to load and
analyze data respectively.
API calls are located in the `transcriptic.config` module for more advanced connection needs.
