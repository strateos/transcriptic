Changelog
=========

v9.6.3
----------

Fixed
-----
- Allow empty body in put post patch requests with rsa requests

v9.6.2
----------

Fixed
-----
- Always rebuild authorization headers even on redirects

Updated
-------
- Pin CI environment to Ubuntu 20.04 to support running Py 36 tests

v9.6.1
------

Updated
---------
- Transcriptic CLI to use "strateos" not "transcriptic" as default API root


Updated
-------
- Preferring Bearer token over user token when configuring Connection session.
- Using json-api runs endpoint to fetch project runs instead of previous project-runs endpoint. Change was made to
  avoid possible timeouts, and improve efficiency. Fields returned from the original project-runs api call were limited
  to the fields used by the cli. This may be a BREAKING CHANGE if using `config.runs` method.

v9.6.0
------

Fixed
-----

  If passed, will populate on web.

v9.4.0
------

Added
~~~~~

  instructions in the backend.

v9.3.1
------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Adapt the backend url resolution with the new configuration of the frontend client.

v9.3.0
------

Added
~~~~~
- A new `-tc-suggestion/--time-constraints-are-suggestion` flag to `exec`.

Updated
~~~~~~~

- Added support for sessions and absolute time constraint in `exec` CLI command.
  Added "--sessionId", "--schedule-at", and "--schedule-delay" flags.
- The api url expected by the `exec` method has been changed to be the url of
  the new dashboard (unless `--no-redirect` is used). It has the shape:
  `base_url/facility/workcell`. It does not require `http` to be added anymore.


v9.2.0

  named and more intuitive replacement for the existing `-i` option.
